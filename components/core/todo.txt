Group templates into templategroups (STG). Allow to easily add a group and templates. Show existing groups as a tree on
the left side of page. By clicking on a templategroup, show a panel with templates in group (graph-view). By clicking on
one template, a text-editor is shown, where one can edit the template. Parameters are automatically inferred when saving.
By clicking on a template and selecting new-instance, a form for this template is shown. User adds values, and presses
