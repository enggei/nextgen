Definetly:
# open incoming nodes
# retain selected nodes
# Add parameter-types, and use when selecting Set/Add values (only show the valid ones)
# load previous canvas (saved on shutdown, loaded on startup)
# Add-form for all single-values in STModel
# Add Multiple values (5) in dialog
# on delete tree- remove nodes from canvas too (Using Graph-listener ?)cc
# Use SwingUtil input dialog instead of SwingUtilities (support right-click field)
Maybe:
# tree-view for adding/seeing values (chained-method pattern look and feel)
